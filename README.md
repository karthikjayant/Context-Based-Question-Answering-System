# Context-Based-Question-Answering-System
This project develops a Question Answering System using End-to-End Memory Networks. Leveraging Keras and TensorFlow, the system processes text from the bAbI dataset, creating a neural network model that encodes stories and queries to generate accurate answers, improving the efficiency of information retrieval and comprehension.
